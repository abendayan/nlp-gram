Part 1 -- Weights
a) a. Why does the program generate so many long sentences?
Specifically, what grammar rule is responsible and why? What is special about this rule? discuss.

The program generate so many long sentences because every sentence starts with NP,
and the rule:
1	NP	NP PP
give the possibility of an infinite number of NP.

b) The grammar allows multiple adjectives, as in the fine perplexed pickle.
Why do the generated sentences do this so rarely? discuss.

To have an adjective in a sentence, we need to use the rule:
1	Noun	Adj Noun
Meaning that only one rule can give us adjective, but when we have a noun, the grammar
can choose from those rules:
1	Noun	president
1	Noun	sandwich
1	Noun	pickle
1	Noun	chief of staff
1	Noun	floor

So the probability to have an adjective (or multiple adjective) is way lower than the
probability to "stop" and return a noun.

c) Which numbers must you modify to fix the problems in (a) and (b), making the
sentences shorter and the adjectives more frequent? Verify your answer by
generating from the grammar. Discuss your solution (which rules and why).

For the problem in (a):
We have two rules for NP:
1	NP	Det Noun
1	NP	NP PP
We need to give more weight to the rule that will generate sentence less long
(the first rule), so we can use:
2	NP	Det Noun
1	NP	NP PP

For the problem in (b):
We have 6 rules for Noun:
1	Noun	Adj Noun
1	Noun	president
1	Noun	sandwich
1	Noun	pickle
1	Noun	chief of staff
1	Noun	floor
The first rule is choosen 1/6 of the time, so if we change it to
5 Noun  Adj Noun
As it will be choosen 5/10=1/2 of the time, so we will have more adjectives.
